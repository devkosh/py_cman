# py_cman
Uni practice of writing DFS and BFS algorithms for Pacman to find his coin in labyrinth. 

I was using <a href = "http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html#Introduction">UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI</a> course and I have downloaded this amazing <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cs188websitecontent/projects/release/search/v1/001/search.zip">zip archive</a>.

To try out my algorithms you need:

1.Download this project --> <a href = "https://github.com/hlikosh/py_cman/archive/master.zip">here</a>.

2.Unarchive project.

3.Change your directory to the dir of the master-py_cman though your console or IDE.

Console
```
$ cd .../master-py_cman
```

4.To try DFS type in console:
For big maze
```
$ python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs -z .5
```
For open maze
```
$ python pacman.py -l openMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=dfs -z .5
```
5.To try BFS type in console:
For big maze
```
$ python pacman.py -l bigMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5
```
For open maze
```
$ python pacman.py -l openMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs -z .5
```
